### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm interested in working in data analytics or data science. I'm currently selfing teaching on Python applications too, I am interested in app design. 

Some other fun things I like to do in my free time include knitting, drawing, sewing, and painting. I love creativity and the ability to blend the left and right side of my brain!
